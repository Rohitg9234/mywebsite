          <div class="legal-section-content">

            <h3>A) Where data is stored</h3>
            <p>Your data may be stored on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Servers and databases used by our service providers (for example, Supabase and hosting/storage providers)</li>
              <li>Your device (for example, cached data and offline sync queue items)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B) How long we retain data</h3>
            <p>We retain information only for as long as reasonably necessary for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing the Services</li>
              <li>Meeting legal, tax, accounting, and compliance obligations</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Retention periods can vary depending on the data type (e.g., orders and payout records may be retained longer for legal and accounting reasons).</p>

            <h3>C) Deletion and account closure</h3>
            <p>You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us (see "Contact Us").</p>
            <div class="legal-callout">
              <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>D) Data retention upon account deletion</h3>
            <p>If you choose to leave the Platform and request deletion of your account, we will permanently and irreversibly delete all associated data, including but not limited to identity documents (such as Aadhaar and PAN details), uploaded licenses (such as FSSAI), financial and payout information (such as bank account details), operational records, uploaded content, and any other sensitive information linked to your account.</p>
            <p>However, in order to maintain an internal record of your participation on the Platform and to ensure a smoother onboarding experience should you wish to return in the future, we will retain the following basic information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>Email address</li>

              <p>This limited information is stored solely for internal record-keeping purposes and will not be shared with any third party for marketing or other external purposes. We believe this approach strikes a fair balance between respecting your privacy and ensuring continuity of service. If you have any questions or concerns about this practice, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at the contact details provided below.</p>
